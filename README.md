# Jina Executors

This repository provides a selection of [Executors](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/.github/2.0/cookbooks/Executor.md) for [Jina](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina).

**‚öôÔ∏è Executor is how Jina processes Documents.** It is the building block of your Jina data pipeline, providing a specific functional needs: preparing data, encoding it with your model, storing, searching, and more.


## Usage

The following is general guidelines. Check each executor's README for details.

### JinaHub

Each of these Executors are available on our Jinahub distribution platform. They are automatically published on every new change. This is the recommended usage:

#### via Docker image

Use the prebuilt image from JinaHub in your Python code 

```python
from jina import Flow
	
f = Flow().add(uses='jinahub+docker://ExecutorName')
```

#### via source code

Use the source code from JinaHub in your Python code:

```python
from jina import Flow
	
f = Flow().add(uses='jinahub://ExecutorName')
```

This is only for internal usage (Jina AI engineers).

### Via Pypi

1. Install the `executors` package.

	```bash
	pip install git+https://github.com/jina-ai/executors/
	```

1. Use `executors` in your code

   ```python
   from jina import Flow
   from jinahub.type.subtype.ExecutorName import ExecutorName
   
   f = Flow().add(uses=ExecutorName)
   ```


### Via Docker

1. Clone the repo and build the docker image

	```shell
	git clone https://github.com/jina-ai/executors
	cd executors/type/subtype
	docker build -t executor-image .
	```

1. Use `executor-image` in your code

	```python
	from jina import Flow
	
	f = Flow().add(uses='docker://executor-image:latest')
	```

## Create new

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please do **not** commit your new Executor to this repository. This repository is **only** for Jina engineers to better manage in-house executors in a centralized way. You *may* submit PRs to fix bugs/add features to the existing ones.

Use `jina hub new` to create a new Executor, following easy interactive prompts:

![jina_hub_new](./.github/img/hub_new.png)

Then follow the guide on [Executors](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/.github/2.0/cookbooks/Executor.md) and how to [push](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/.github/2.0/cookbooks/Hubble.md) it to the Jina Hub marketplace.

## Using this repository as a package

Notice that we have a `setup.py` in this repository. 
This is **NOT recommended** practice for **external developers** of Executors. 
We added this in order to ease local development for **internal developers**.

This file, along with the `__init__.py`s in each of the folders, do not matter when using the Executors via the `jinahub://` syntax, [above](#jinahub).

## CompoundExecutors

If you want to develop a `CompoundExecutor`-type Executor based on one of the classes provided in this package, you can either:

- fork this repo and add it as a separate folder. Start with `jina hub new`, and then follow the design patterns we have established in [here](jinahub/indexers/searcher/compound) and in the [docs](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/.github/2.0/cookbooks/Executor.md).
- copy-paste the class you want to have a component of your `CompoundExecutor`, and add it as a class in your Executor's package
