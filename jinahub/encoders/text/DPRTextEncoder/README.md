# ✨  DPRTextEncoder

 **DPRTextEncoder** is a class that encodes text into embeddings using the DPR model from huggingface transformers.

The **DPR** model was originally proposed in [Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04906).

This encoder supports both the DPR context and question encoders - you should specify which type you are using with the `encoder_type` parameter.

The following parameters can be passed on initialization:

- `pretrained_model_name_or_path`: Can be either:
	- the model id of a pretrained model hosted inside a model repo
		on huggingface.co.
	- A path to a directory containing model weights, saved using
		the transformers model's `save_pretrained()` method
- `encoder_type`: Either `'context'` or `'question'`. Make sure this
	matches the model that you are using.
- `base_tokenizer_model`: Base tokenizer model. The possible values are
	the same as for the ``pretrained_model_name_or_path`` parameters. If not
	provided, the ``pretrained_model_name_or_path`` parameter value will be used
- `title_tag_key`: The key under which the titles are saved in the documents'
    tag property. It is recommended to set this property for context encoders,
    to match the model pre-training. It has no effect for question encoders.
- `max_length`: Max length argument for the tokenizer
- `default_batch_size`: Default batch size for encoding, used if the
	batch size is not passed as a parameter with the request.
- `default_traversal_paths`: Default traversal paths for encoding, used if the
	traversal path is not passed as a parameter with the request.
- `device`: The device (cpu or gpu) that the model should be on.

## 🌱 Prerequisites

> These are only needed if you download the source code and directly use the class. Not needed if you use the Jina Hub method below. 

You can install the requirements with

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usages

### 🚚 Via JinaHub

Use the prebuilt images from JinaHub in your python codes, 

```python
from jina import Flow
	
f = Flow().add(
    uses='jinahub+docker://DPRTextEncoder',
)
```

or in the `.yml` config.
	
```yaml
jtype: Flow
pods:
  - name: encoder
    uses: 'jinahub+docker://DPRTextEncoder'
```

## 🎉️ Example 


```python
from jina import Flow, Document
import numpy as np
	
f = Flow().add(uses='jinahub+docker://DPRTextEncoder')

with f:
    f.post(
        on='/foo', 
        inputs=Document(text='your text'), 
        on_done=print
    )
```


### Inputs 

[Documents](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/.github/2.0/cookbooks/Document.md) with the [`text`](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/.github/2.0/cookbooks/Document.md#document-attributes) attribute. If you are using a context encoder the documents can additionally have a title tag, see initialization parameters.

### Returns

[Documents](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/.github/2.0/cookbooks/Document.md) with the `embedding` attribute filled with an `ndarray` of the shape `768` with `dtype=float32`.
