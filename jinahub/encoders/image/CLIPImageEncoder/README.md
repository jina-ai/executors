# CLIPImageEncoder

**CLIPImageEncoder** is a class that wraps the image embedding functionality using the **CLIP** model from huggingface transformers.

The **CLIP** model originally was proposed in [Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/Learning_Transferable_Visual_Models_From_Natural_Language_Supervision.pdf).
