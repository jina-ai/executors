# AudioCLIPEncoder

**AudioCLIPEncoder** is a class that wraps the [AudioCLIP](https://github.com/AndreyGuzhov/AudioCLIP) model for generating embeddings for audio data.

This encoder is meant to be used in conjunction with the [AudioCLIPTextEncoder](https://hub.jina.ai/executor/jfe8kovq) and [AudioCLIPTextEncoder](https://hub.jina.ai/executor/jfe8kovq), as it can embed text, images and audio to the same latent space.
