# VADSpeechSegmenter

**VADSpeechSegmenter** segments speech audio using Silero VAD (voice activity detector). Instead of segmenting according to time at fixed-length intervals, it segments based on voice activity. This VAD is similar to WebRTC but instead of differentiating voice from silence. It differenciates voice from noise/music/silence. The segmented audios are stored in the chunks.
