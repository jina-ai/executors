# ✨ Image Normalizer

**Image Normalizer** is a class that resizes, crops and normalizes images.
Since normalization is highly dependent on the model, 
it is recommended to have it as part of the encoders instead of using it in a dedicated executor.
Therefore, misconfigurations resulting in a training-serving-gap are less likely.

The following parameters can be used:

- `resize_dim` (int): The size of the image after resizing
- `target_size` (tuple or int): The dimensions to crop the image to (center cropping is used)
- `img_mean` (tuple, default (0,0,0)): The mean for normalization
- `img_std` (tuple, default (1,1,1)): The standard deviation for normalization
- `channel_axis` (int): The channel axis in the images used
- `target_channel_axis` (int): The desired channel axis in the images. If this is not equal to the channel_axis, the axis is moved.
- `target_dtype` (np.dtype, default `np.float32`): The desired type of the image array

## 🌱 Prerequisites


> These are only needed if you download the source code and directly use the class. Not needed if you use the Jina Hub method below.

In case you want to install the dependencies locally run 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usages

### 🚚 Via JinaHub

#### using docker images
Use the prebuilt images from JinaHub in your Python code: 

```python
from jina import Flow
	
f = Flow().add(uses='jinahub+docker://ImageNormalizer')
```

or in the `.yml` config.
	
```yaml
jtype: Flow
pods:
  - name: crafter
    uses: 'jinahub+docker://ImageNormalizer'
    uses_with: 
      target_size: 42
``` 

#### using source code
Use the source code from JinaHub in your Python code:

```python
from jina import Flow
	
f = Flow().add(uses='jinahub://ImageNormalizer')
```

or in the `.yml` config.

```yaml
jtype: Flow
pods:
  - name: crafter
    uses: 'jinahub://ImageNormalizer'
```



## 🎉️ Example 


```python
from jina import Flow, Document

f = Flow().add(uses='jinahub+docker://ImageNormalizer')

with f:
    resp = f.post(on='foo', inputs=Document(), return_results=True)
    print(f'{resp}')
```

### Inputs 

`Document` with image `blob`.

### Returns

`Document` with overridden image `blob` that is normalized, scaled, cropped and resized as instructed.
